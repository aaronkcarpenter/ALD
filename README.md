## Product Page
After the user selects a product to get more information about, they are directed
to the product page. Here, they can choose a size, see more pictures of the product,
a different color, and eventually add the item to their shopping cart.

## Checkout Page
Finally, product(s) have been chosen and it is now time to checkout. At this point,
all that is needed is for you to confirm the product and charges and check out.

## Customer Journey Completion
At this point, no actual checkout takes place since this is indeed a cloned site,
so users, recruiters, teachers are instructed to visit my professional profiles
and are also able to email me.
